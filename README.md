# kinderneutron-alpha
Welcome to the alpha version (v1) of kinderneutron! This repository contains the source code for a Python program that utilizes YOLO (You Only Look Once) for real-time human detection through webcam feed. The system integrates with an Arduino to control a digital pin based on the presence of a detected person.
